          Rowdy is strong, brave, intimidating, and many more adjectives. One example proving this is when Arnold says, “Rowdy is the toughest kid on the rez. He is long and lean and strong like a snake.” (Alexie 15). I do not think that his appearance really changes throughout the novel, but he does become a bit emotional, like when Arnold’s sister passed away: “That made Rowdy sort of choke. He gasped a little. And more tears rolled down his face.” (Alexie 210)

        <h2>Important Relationship: Arnold</h2>
        <p><strong>Arnold:</strong> Rowdy and Junior have been best friends since birth: “Both of us were pushed into the world on November 5, 1992, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane.” (Alexie 17). However, Arnold decided that he wanted to transfer schools to get a better education, and this made Rowdy feel betrayed. But later, he forgave Arnold, and their relationship healed. I will represent their relationship with a tree, where Rowdy and Arnold are both branches of the tree, because they always lead back to the same roots, similar to how they shared everything from the beginning.</p>

        <h2>Important Relationship: Father</h2>
        <p><strong>Rowdy's Father:</strong> Rowdy’s father is abusive towards him and his mother due to alcohol: “His father is drinking hard and throwing punches, so Rowdy and his mother are always walking around with bruised and bloody faces.” (Alexie 16), which may be the reason why Rowdy is “the toughest kid on the rez” (Alexie 15). Although this may seem bad, sometimes their relationship is good. For example, when Arnold brought him his cartoon of them together, his father answered the door, and he seemed pretty calm. He simply took the drawing and brought it to Rowdy without any fuss.</p>

        <h2>Character Growth and Development</h2>
        <p>I believe that Rowdy does change throughout the novel. At the very beginning, it seemed like he would not betray Arnold, but later in the story, when Arnold decided that he would transfer schools, Rowdy became enraged, and even after the countless hours they have spent together: “So that means Rowdy and I have spent 40,880 hours in each other’s company.” (Alexie 24), they had became enemies. To be fair, from Rowdy’s perspective, Arnold was betraying him, not the other way around, but in that moment, he didn’t understand why Arnold would do such a thing. Rowdy later started not to be as angry with Arnold, and started to slightly understand him, which is a big change from the beginning: “But Rowdy still respect my cartoons. And so maybe he still respects me a little bit.” (Alexie 103). In the last chapter of the book, after everything that has happened, including Rowdy blaming Arnold for the death of Arnold’s sister, he calmly asks Arnold to play basketball with him, and he does not seem angry at all anymore. This shows us how Rowdy changed throughout the novel, from being Arnold's friend, to his enemy, to his friend again.</p>

        <h2>Key Quotation</h2>
        <p>'"No, I'm serious. I always knew you were going to leave. I always knew you were going to leave us behind and travel the world. I had this dream about you a few months ago. You were standing on the Great Wall of China. You looked happy. And I was happy for you."' (Alexie 229)</p>
        <p>This quote is important to Rowdy’s character because it shows us that all this time, he was actually happy for Arnold. Earlier in the story, he would be very mean to Arnold, for his change in education, and he personally felt betrayed, but maybe this was just something in that moment, and when he had more time to think about it, he started to feel happy for Arnold.</p>
